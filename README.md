Main repository for "DProvDB: Differentially Private Query Processing with Multi-Analyst Provenance", accepted to appear in Proc. of the ACM on Management of Data (PACMMOD/SIGMOD'2024) [[bibtex](#citation)] [[tech report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10240)]

  
  

## Brief Intro

  

DProvDB projects aims to build an online DP query processing system where multiple data analysts (with different trust levels) are involved -- these data analysts are not allowed to collude by law or regulations but have the incentive to collude (for a more accurate query answer). We would like to develop DP algorithms that can minimize the privacy loss when the analysts are compromised and build a system &ndash; DProvDB &ndash; to maximize the total number of queries that can be answered given a fixed privacy budget.

  

This repository contains the implementation of the DProvDB system.

# TL’DR


We provide automatic scripts for installing DProvDB, running it, and reproducing the experimental results presented in the paper.

  

```markdown
# install prerequisite packages and DProvDB
bash ./install.sh

# run DProvDB
bash ./run.sh

# plot results
bash ./plot.sh

```

  

Note that the experiment code can run for a while (typically 1-2 hours since it contains 4 runs for all experiments). Then, the plots for the paper can be found in the “/plot_code” directory.

  

If you want to manually install and run or test with your own test cases, we suggest reading the rest of the Code Guide.

# Installation Guide

  

## Hardware Requirements

  

- This codebase has been tested on Linux (Ubuntu 22.04), Mac (M1 chip), and Windows 10 (w. WSL) platforms. **We recommend Linux** for a stable testbed, and the following code guides are for Linux.

- The system code is written in Scala/Java and includes some scripts written in Python. So this codebase should be independent of specific hardware requirements.

-  **16 GB RAM** should be sufficient for reproducing the experimental results for this codebase.

  

## Datasets

  

The experimental results are evaluated over two datasets:

  

- The **Adult dataset** from UCI Machine Learning Repository (accessible in the code repository).

- The **TPC-H dataset** generated using the TPC-H kit with 1 GB scale factor (https://github.com/gregrahn/tpch-kit).

  

## Software Requirements

  

- Java Runtime Environment w. packaging tools MVN and SBT (**both**).

- Scala version =2.12.2

- PostgreSQL version=16.1

- CMake, GCC (for generating TPC-H dataset)

  

## Installing DProvDB

  

- First, clone and open the codebase.

  

```markdown
git clone https://github.com/DProvDB/DProvDB.git
cd DProvDB
```

  

- Install Chorus as a submodule

  

```markdown
git submodule add https://github.com/uvm-plaid/chorus.git chorus
git submodule update --init --recursive

cd chorus
mvn install
cd ..
```

Note: potential missing dependencies for Chorus. If there is an error, add the following to the SBT file.

> libraryDependencies += "com.google.guava" % "guava" % "28.0-jre"
  
 If slf4j version is not compatible with the platform, try changing the "org.slf4j" package version in "chorus/pom.xml" version to "1.7.13" (available: Sept, 2024).

- Preparing data (i.e., load into PostgreSQL), using Adult as an example (Similarly, import TPC-H dataset with [TPC-H kit](https://ankane.org/tpc-h)).

  

```markdown
createdb adult
psql adult

CREATE TABLE adult (AGE INTEGER NOT NULL,
WORKCLASS VARCHAR(55) NOT NULL,
FNLWQT INTEGER NOT NULL,
EDUCATION VARCHAR(55) NOT NULL,
EDUCATION_NUM INTEGER NOT NULL,
MARITAL_STATUS VARCHAR(55) NOT NULL,
OCCUPATION VARCHAR(55) NOT NULL,
RELATIONSHIP VARCHAR(55) NOT NULL,
RACE VARCHAR(55) NOT NULL,
SEX VARCHAR(55) NOT NULL,
CAPITAL_GAIN INTEGER NOT NULL,
CAPITAL_LOSS INTEGER NOT NULL,
HOURS_PER_WEEK INTEGER NOT NULL,
NATIVE_COUNTRY VARCHAR(55) NOT NULL,
SALARY VARCHAR(55) NOT NULL);

\copy adult FROM './data/adult.data' DELIMITER ',' CSV

CREATE USER link WITH PASSWORD '12345';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON TABLE adult TO link;

exit;
```

  

Note: This testing PostgreSQL is listening to the default port 5432; **If you are using another port or another username/password**, please update line 40-42 in ‘src/main/scala/Experiments/Experiments.scala’ accordingly.

One can also use their own data with DProvDB, but the DB schema needs to be properly configured in 'src/test/resources/schema.yaml'.

  

# Testing with DProvDB

  

## Manually Run and Evaluate DProvDB

  

### Running DProvDB Code

  

Under ‘/DProvDB’ directory, run the following command with args filled in.

  

We enable four arguments:

  

- [args1]: dataset, must be "adult" or "tpch";

- [args2]: task, must be "RRQ" or "EQW";

- [args3]: table, e.g., "adult", or "orders";

- [args4]: 5 letters to decide which experiment(s) to run, "T" for run, "F" for not run. e.g., "TFTFT" meaning running all experiments except the 2nd and the 4th.

  

```markdown
sbt "run [args1] [args2] [args3] [args4]"
```

  

For example, to run all five experiments on the adult dataset using RRQ, use

  

```markdown
sbt "run adult RRQ adult TTTTT"
```

  

Note: the experimental results data file is automatically stored in ‘data/’.
